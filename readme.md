# Webpack Starter
A project to start doing things in javascript using webpack to minify the generated files.

## Configuration Steps

1. Fork this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in this project's package.json file.
3. Look for the text "`<<App title>>`" in the webpack.config.js configuration file to change the Html Title for the generated index.html file.
4. Start coding in the index.js file under the src folder.
5. Remember to change the specific details for your project in the package.json file. Author name, application name and so on.
6. Run `npm run server` in the terminal to start the http server for your project.
7. Browse to (http://localhost:3000/). Whenever you change one file in the dist folder, the browser will refresh automatically to see your changes.

Any suggestions you have or if you see some possible optimization for this project I'll be pleased to receive your suggestion. You can also ask for a pull request if you want to contribute in this starter project.

Sincerely,


José Ramón Suero
